I am an information technology manager for Legal Aid of Nebraska. As the only in-house IT staff for an organization of about 75 employees and 7 offices, I am responsible for the proper functioning of all systems and devices which use electricity and are not a kitchen appliance. I am also responsible for management of and development of innovative projects that help serve Legal Aidâ€™s mission.

### More Information

Besides being an all-systems systems administrator, I am also a licensed Nebraska attorney. Before transitioning into the IT field, at Legal Aid I represented low-income Nebraskans in court and administrative proceedings in a wide variety of civil legal matters. My passions include tenant rights, freedom of information, whistleblower protection, access to justice and free and open source software.
